Solitr lets you focus on strategy and relaxation as you lose yourself in the addictive simplicity of this beloved card game. And the best part is there is no clean up since it's all digital!\n\nHow to Play Solitr\nThe objective of the Solitr game is similar to that of the tabletop card version of Solitaire—you must move all your cards to the four foundation piles located in the upper right corner of the screen, leaving none on the board.\n\nThe rules are straightforward—stack each pile of cards in ascending order from King to Ace of the same suit. Once you have a complete ascending order, you can place these cards in the upper right corner. There is a hidden stockpile at the top left of the screen, which you can choose to display one or three cards, but only one will be available for movement at a time.\n\nYou will want to strategically move the uncovered stockpile card onto one of the seven tableau columns, depending on whether it can be placed in ascending order. You can drag cards to move them onto the seven tableau columns or to the four foundations. Remember that the seven columns only allow for alternating colors to be placed in ascending order.\n\nFor building rules, cards in the foundations must be stacked by the same suit in ascending order, from Ace to King. In the tableau, cards need to be stacked in alternating colors, from high rank (King) to low rank (Ace). Additionally, any empty spots in the tableau can be filled with a King of any suit.\n\nAs the deck is shuffled in random order, you must carefully strategize to find the correct moves as you reveal cards one by one. This is the essence of the solitaire challenge.\n\nYou can move either single cards or piles of cards within the tableau, but you can only move cards from the waste pile. Whenever you expose a face-down card in a tableau column, that card will automatically turn face-up for you.",

Will you become a master wordsmith in this delightful word game?\n\nHow to Play Words of Wonders\nWords of Wonders is an engaging word puzzle game that combines the excitement of crossword puzzles with the thrill of word search. Players form words by connecting letters in a grid, unlocking hidden words,, and progressing through levels.\n\nYou'll see a grid of random letters when you start the game. Each grid represents a level; your task is to find words by connecting adjacent letters. You can swipe your finger over the letters in any direction—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—to form words. Longer words and more complex combinations may unlock bonus rewards, so watch for opportunities to maximize your word choices.\n\nConnect the letters to form a word. It will be revealed if the word you formed is on the crossword grid.

These tools can reveal letters or help you find the next word, though they're limited, so use them wisely. There are also rewards for completing levels or discovering difficult words, such as coins or additional hints, which can help you advance further.\n\nProgress through the levels and collect unique background images with each new milestone. The levels get more difficult by introducing longer words and more letters, increasing the chances of getting it wrong and challenging your vocabulary skills!\n\nSome levels feature specific themes, like landmarks or animals, where the words you form are related to that theme. As you progress, you’ll unlock different \"worlds\" or locations, each with unique challenges and puzzles. You also get fun bits of info throughout, like learning that The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.\n\nThe goal is to find all the words in the grid before you run out of moves or time. Each level has a set number of words to complete in order to progress to the next stage. You may also encounter bonus rounds or challenges that offer extra rewards when completed.\n\nAs you move through levels, you'll earn points, coins, and other rewards, which will help you advance in the game.

The game is easy for anyone to play, so pick up a cue and line up your first shot.\n\nHow to Play 8 Ball Billiards Classic\n8 Ball Billiards Classic is much like the classic in-person game -- your goal is to pocket all your balls (either solids or stripes) and sink the 8-ball to win. Use your mouse to aim the cue stick and adjust the power of your shot. Click and drag the cue stick back to set your shot’s power, then release it to strike the cue ball. This is a 2-player game, so carefully plan each shot to outmaneuver whoever you're playing with and clear the table before they do!\n\nPick a ball\n8-Ball Billiards is an intuitive billiards game where you must pot all striped or spotted balls, depending on what you're assigned to. The balls you’re assigned depend on what ball is potted first so shoot for the win!\n\nLine up your cue\nThe controls are easy. Simply click and drag to find the right level of force, then line up the angle with the ball that seems easiest to pot next. Remember that this is pool, so save the 8-ball until you have potted all your balls—otherwise, you will lose!\n\nFeatures\nEasy and intuitive controls\nPlay against the computer or a friend\nKeep track of your stats\nSmooth graphics and animations\nSave your in-game progress to your CrazyGames account",

Whether teaming up with friends or meeting new rivals, every round is an electrifying mix of fun and intensity. Do you have what it takes to emerge victorious?\n\nHow to Play Survival Rush\nYou start the game of Survival Rush by entering a room name if you know of one, and if not leave it blank to be placed in a random adventure. Each room throws you into a completely different challenge, testing your speed, strategy, and survival instincts. The challenges are a bit surreal and sometimes downright eerie.\n\nOne challenge drops you into a deadly game of red light, green light one two three. A towering doll watches your every move, ready to take you down the moment you slip up. Run when the light is green, freeze when it turns red, and don’t even think about moving at the wrong time.\n\nAnother challenge sends you leaping across floating blocks, but not all of them are stable. Some will hold your weight—others will send you plunging into the abyss. Step carefully, time your jumps, and don’t trust every platform you see.\n\nIn the most chaotic rooms, you’ll find yourself on the run from relentless pursuers, ready to pummel you into oblivion. Swing your baseball bat to fight back, keep moving, and always watch your back—because in Survival Rush, danger never takes a break.\n\nStay sharp, follow the rules, and don’t let distractions throw you off. Your fellow players might cheer you on, but only the toughest make it to the end. Think you’ve got what it takes? Prove it!\n\nWant exclusive skins, expert tips, and more?
